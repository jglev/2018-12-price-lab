## Resources to have open or available

- Installation instructions for `python` (version 3.7) and `bash`:
  1. Install Python:  Follow the instructions for your computer under "Installing Python Using Anaconda" at [Software Carpentry's website](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/setup/)
    (Don't worry about the other sections, "Getting the Data" or "Starting Python")
  2. For Windows users: Install ["GitBash" / "Git for Windows"](https://gitforwindows.org/)

- **[PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal) 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)** the Style Guide for writing Python
	- If you like PEP 8, you'll also probably like **[PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal) 20](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/),** *The Zen of Python,* on the philosophy of the Python community.
